# OVAL
The Oklahoma Virtual Academic Laboratory (OVAL) is a VR-Classroom application by University of Oklahoma Libraries encouraging collaboration between academics, professors, and students. Up to twenty users can inhabit the same VR space, import any 3D model on the fly, and analyze 3D models with built-in tools.

### Hardware Dependencies
This version of OVAL requires the use of an Oculus Rift CV1, a Leap Motion Hand Tracker, and a 3Dconnexion SpaceNavigator 3D Mouse.

### Known Bugs
1. Menu text may be garbled after opening the file browser within OVAL. To fix, exit back to the main menu and rejoin OVAL.
2. Video capture action does not record microphone audio of the user.
3. Video capture freezes OVAL for 3-5 seconds when first selected. After this, OVAL performs normally.
